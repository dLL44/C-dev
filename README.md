Im doing raycasting developmenmt with SDL2 and im fucking losing it

## you actually want to see it? it dont work but alr
first u gotta have mingw64 w/ gcc and SDL2 in the project.
put the entirety of SDL2 mingw64 include folder in the include/SDL2 folder
then put the SDL2.dll in the project folder.
Start mingw64 and cd to the projects folder and do 
``
 $ ./START.sh
``
and a exe called untiled will appear after the make finishes.
